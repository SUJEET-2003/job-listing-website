# Premium Job Listing Website

## Project Overview
This is a fully responsive, frontend-only Job Listing Website built as part of my internship task. I designed it with a modern, dark-themed "Tech Startup" UI. 

The core feature is a dynamic filtering system. Users can search for jobs by keyword, location, category, and experience level. The job cards update instantly without the page needing to reload, providing a smooth and fast user experience.

## Features
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Instantly filter jobs by title, location, category, or experience level.
* **Premium Dark UI:** Custom glowing typography, glassmorphism elements, and smooth hover animations.
* **Fully Responsive:** Adapts perfectly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using CSS Grid.
* **Interactive Modals:** Detailed job descriptions open in a clean, animated overlay.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the core structure.
* **Tailwind CSS (via CDN):** For rapid, responsive styling and grid layouts.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For handling the dynamic filtering logic, DOM manipulation, and the custom typewriter text effect.
* **Custom CSS:** For advanced animations, scrollbar styling, and glowing gradient text.
